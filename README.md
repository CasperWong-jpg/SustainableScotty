## I. Goals and Rationale

Carnegie Mellon’s campus is known to pursue greener horizons. As a campus, we are continuing to make crucial steps forward, but an important part of making CMU more sustainable is incentivizing the student body to get involved. Sustainable Scotty was developed by CMU’s Sustainable Earth Club and began work in Fall 2020. The objective of this app is to utilize technology to further sustainable habits and lifestyles at CMU through rewards and an online community of peers. At CMU, many are highly focused on academics and people sometimes acquiesce their lifestyle habits which are sometimes unsustainable. The app not only encourages students to log sustainable actions for real life, CMU-related rewards but has built-in accountability and an online community. Each logged action is posted as a picture to the profile of the individual and to the broader community on the app. Being green brings everyone together and reaps rewards too.

## III. Features and Components 

***Logging actions***:  Our team utilized Adobe XD to visualize the app’s flows and function from a user’s perspective. After an individual downloads and signs into the app, they will be directed to a page with sustainable actions delineated by categories of frequency and actions near the person’s location. See figure 1 for the opening page. 

>Figure 1:

On the upper right, a person can quickly check their reward/ coin balance and ensure that they are signed into their account. The app also records the amount of times the person has logged an action on an action’s logo. 

To log an action, a person must select one of the sustainable action icons which will contain a description and fun fact about the action. They will then be redirected to their device’s camera to take a picture of their action. See Figure 2 for an example of an action’s description and a prompt to take a picture. The picture of the action and an accompanying caption will be uploaded to their profile and they will be notified about how many coins they received and how much Carbon Dioxide they saved in pounds (see Figure 3).

***Profiles and community***: Another goal of this app is to create a community of sustainably- minded people at CMU. The more a person logs sustainable actions, the more posts they will share to different groups and communities on the app. A profile will resemble something like Figure 4 with analytics about how many people a person is friends with, how many coins they have and how many actions they have logged accompanying a grid of pictures.

If a person would like to see or manage their groups or friends, they can select the person icon on the bottom of the screen ( third from the left). Figure 5 shows the page of all the groups an individual is a part of, which can range from large and broad academic circles to more close-knit and small groups.

Within the group, a person can see a leaderboard based on how many pounds of Carbon Dioxide saved. This helps to foster competition and camaraderie between friends and peers for a sustainable, environmental end. Figure 6 and 7 show a leaderboard of people in the graduating class of 2022+ and where an individual could rank on the board.

***Rewards***: Every sustainable action has a different coin value based on how much Carbon Dioxide is saved. Each person will have a bank of all of the coin rewards accrued from logging sustainable actions. These coins can be used to purchase environmentally conscious digital infrastructure and products such as solar panels and green buildings. These items can be used to create a ditigal personalized model of a sustainable, green city. In addition, the coins can also be used to buy real life CMU-related treats such as a free coffee or cookie. Real life rewards cost more coins. Figure 8 shows the rewards page and options.
